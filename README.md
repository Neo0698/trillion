Hie and thanks to have some interest for this app we advise you to read this paragraph. in this paragraph i will explain you how  this app work and in wich way we think that this app is usefull.<p></p>
So firstly this app is a webbrowser combine with a search engine, but it's not only a search engine or a webbrowser it's also a social network, know you are asking our self why we have made an app that a search engine, a webbrower and a social network, let us explain.

Search engine find website but often if you look for information the website belongs to company that have the money to make a website but we thought that is it not better that not only a company or big university could express their opinion but every one and very simpelly. for us the idear is good but we add problem how to put the most interesting post before or delet the post where they are fake news or rasicime. To do that we use AI that we have develop in our server.



**how info works?**
<p></p>
info is lots of complex algorith that found a websit if you put only the websit name. But what happens if you ask a phrase. The programme will found in his data if someone have created a post witch contains your information and class it.
**I hope that you think that the idear is good, And thanks for installing it with the link underneist**

 <p>firstly slide our finger to access to the second bar where you can add our opinion(like on the picture below).</p>
 
 
 <p>Secondly</p>
To do a great post you need to know really basic ***html***. This his an exemple of a post for my instagram account

<image src="https://github.com/Neo0698/info2/blob/master/html.PNG">


In this exemple i answer to obvious question that a user can ask, for exemple the exemple before answer the question
  <p>-new macbook</p>
  <p>-new android phone</p>
  <p>-new iphone</p>
  <p>-technologie instagram account</p>
  <p>-microcoder</p>
this are all the question that someone can ask and we can find the same text in the post so the programme can show your post we an user ask all those question.

***this is for us the only sollution to make internet better, by putting every one opinion on a subject***
if we use ad it's to pay some developer and to have some better serveur for know we use rasberry pi that are computer that cost less than 40euros
